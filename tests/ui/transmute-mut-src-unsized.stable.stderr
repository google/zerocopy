    = note: the following trait bounds were not satisfied:
            `[u8]: Sized`
            `<[u8; 1] as KnownLayout>::PointerMetadata = usize`
            which is required by `Wrap<&mut [u8], &mut [u8; 1]>: TransmuteMutDst<'_>`
    = note: this error originates in the macro `transmute_mut` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
