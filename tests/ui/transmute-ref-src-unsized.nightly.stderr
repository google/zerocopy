   = note: the following trait bounds were not satisfied:
           `[u8]: Sized`
           `<[u8; 1] as KnownLayout>::PointerMetadata = usize`
           which is required by `zerocopy::util::macro_util::Wrap<&[u8], &[u8; 1]>: zerocopy::util::macro_util::TransmuteRefDst<'_>`
   = note: the full name for the type has been written to '/long-type-HASH.txt'
   = note: consider using `--verbose` to print the full type name to the console
   = note: this error originates in the macro `transmute_ref` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
