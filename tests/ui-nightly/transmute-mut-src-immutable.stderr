   = warning: this will change its meaning in a future release!
   = note: for more information, see issue #123748 <https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/123748>
   = help: specify the type explicitly
   = note: `#[warn(never_type_fallback_flowing_into_unsafe)]` on by default
   = note: this warning originates in the macro `$crate::assert_type_size_eq` which comes from the expansion of the macro `transmute_mut` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
