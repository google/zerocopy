error[E0599]: the method `transmute_mut` exists for struct `Wrap<&mut [u8], &mut [u8; 1]>`, but its trait bounds were not satisfied

   | --------------------------------------------------------- doesn't satisfy `Wrap<&mut [u8], &mut [u8; 1]>: TransmuteMutDst`
   |
   = note: the following trait bounds were not satisfied:
           `[u8]: Sized`
           `<[u8; 1] as KnownLayout>::PointerMetadata = usize`
           which is required by `Wrap<&mut [u8], &mut [u8; 1]>: TransmuteMutDst`
   = note: this error originates in the macro `transmute_mut` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
