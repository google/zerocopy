            # Ensure all dependencies are downloaded - both for our crates and for
            # tools we use in CI. We don't care about these tools succeeding for
            # two reasons: First, this entire job is best-effort since it's just a
            # performance optimization. Second, there may be failures due to
            # issues other than failing to download dependencies (e.g., `cargo
            # metadata` called with a malformed `Cargo.toml`, build failure in our
            # own crate or in dependencies, etc). For those reasons, we discard
            # stderr and ignore status codes.
            #
            # For downloading our crates' dependencies in particular, note that
