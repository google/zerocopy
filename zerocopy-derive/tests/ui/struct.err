{"message":"transparent struct cannot have other repr hints","code":{"code":"E0692","explanation":"A `repr(transparent)` type was also annotated with other, incompatible\nrepresentation hints.\n\nErroneous code example:\n\n```compile_fail,E0692\n#[repr(transparent, C)] // error: incompatible representation hints\nstruct Grams(f32);\n```\n\nA type annotated as `repr(transparent)` delegates all representation concerns to\nanother type, so adding more representation hints is contradictory. Remove\neither the `transparent` hint or the other hints, like this:\n\n```\n#[repr(transparent)]\nstruct Grams(f32);\n```\n\nAlternatively, move the other attributes to the contained type:\n\n```\n#[repr(C)]\nstruct Foo {\n    x: i32,\n    // ...\n}\n\n#[repr(transparent)]\nstruct FooWrapper(Foo);\n```\n\nNote that introducing another `struct` just to have a place for the other\nattributes may have unintended side effects on the representation:\n\n```\n#[repr(transparent)]\nstruct Grams(f32);\n\n#[repr(C)]\nstruct Float(f32);\n\n#[repr(transparent)]\nstruct Grams2(Float); // this is not equivalent to `Grams` above\n```\n\nHere, `Grams2` is a not equivalent to `Grams` -- the former transparently wraps\na (non-transparent) struct containing a single float, while `Grams` is a\ntransparent wrapper around a float.
