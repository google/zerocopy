## Yanks and Regressions

### 0.7.27, 0.7.28

These versions were briefly yanked due to a non-soundness regression reported in
[#672][pull-672]. After reconsidering our yanking policy in [#679][issue-679],
we un-yanked these versions.

[pull-672]: https://github.com/google/zerocopy/pull/672
[issue-679]: https://github.com/google/zerocopy/issues/679
