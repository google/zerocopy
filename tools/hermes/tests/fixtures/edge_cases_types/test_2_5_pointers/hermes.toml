description = """
Purpose: Validates logic compilation maps correctly parsing raw pointers without panic.
Behavior: Includes standard Rust raw pointers (`*const u8`, `*mut u8`) and abstractions (`NonNull<u8>`). Tests that their presence correctly traverses Charon safely despite being un-provable natively by functional semantics.
