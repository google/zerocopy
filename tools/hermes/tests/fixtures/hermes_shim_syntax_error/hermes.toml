Purpose: Tests Hermes' internal parsing fail-safes.
Behavior: Introduces a malformed token stream (`pub fn oops((`) and leverages an empty Charon mock. Asserts that Hermes aborts with an internal syntax error diagnostic immediately upon discovering the un-parseable file instead of delegating to Charon.
