Purpose: Ensures `--start-from` traversal deep into file-based modules.
Behavior: Uses a deeply targeted analysis pointer (`crate::foo::bar::deep_proof`) to seek a proof enclosed in physically separated `src/foo/bar.rs` layout. Ensures nested resolution handles the directory hierarchy transparently.
