Purpose: Verifies detection of annotated items that are hidden from the compiler via `#[cfg]`.
Behavior: Places a Hermes annotation on a function blocked by `#[cfg(target_os = "haiku")]`. Expects failure since Hermes' surface parser sees the doc comment, but Charon fails because the target item does not exist in the compiled MIR.
