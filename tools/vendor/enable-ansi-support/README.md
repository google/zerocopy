## About

This crate provides one function, `enable_ansi_support`, which allows ANSI escape codes to work on Windows 10 and above.
Call `enable_ansi_support` *once*, early on in `main()`, to enable ANSI escape codes generated by crates like
[`ansi_term`](https://docs.rs/ansi_term) or [`owo-colors`](https://docs.rs/owo-colors) to work on Windows just like they
do on Unix platforms.

On non-Windows platforms, `enable_ansi_support` is a no-op.

## Example

```rust
fn main() {
    match enable_ansi_support::enable_ansi_support() {
        Ok(()) => {
            // ANSI escape codes were successfully enabled, or this is a non-Windows platform.
            // Use your terminal color library of choice here.
            println!("\x1b[31mHello, world\x1b[0m");
        }
        Err(_) => {
            // The operation was unsuccessful, typically because it's running on an older
            // version of Windows. The program may choose to disable ANSI color code output in
            // this case.
        }
    }
}
```

## Minimum supported Rust version

The minimum supported Rust version (MSRV) is **1.71**. The MSRV will be updated sparingly.
