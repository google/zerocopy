/// Implements trait(s) for a type or verifies the given implementation by
/// referencing an existing (derived) implementation.
///
/// This macro exists so that we can provide zerocopy-derive as an optional
/// dependency and still get the benefit of using its derives to validate that
/// our trait impls are sound.
///
/// When compiling without `--cfg 'feature = "derive"` and without `--cfg test`,
/// `impl_or_verify!` emits the provided trait impl. When compiling with either
/// of those cfgs, it is expected that the type in question is deriving the
/// traits instead. In this case, `impl_or_verify!` emits code which validates
/// that the given trait impl is at least as restrictive as the the impl emitted
/// by the custom derive. This has the effect of confirming that the impl which
/// is emitted when the `derive` feature is disabled is actually sound (on the
/// assumption that the impl emitted by the custom derive is sound).
///
/// The caller is still required to provide a safety comment (e.g. using the
/// `safety_comment!` macro) . The reason for this restriction is that, while
/// `impl_or_verify!` can guarantee that the provided impl is sound when it is
/// compiled with the appropriate cfgs, there is no way to guarantee that it is
/// ever compiled with those cfgs. In particular, it would be possible to
/// accidentally place an `impl_or_verify!` call in a context that is only ever
/// compiled when the `derive` feature is disabled. If that were to happen,
/// there would be nothing to prevent an unsound trait impl from being emitted.
/// Requiring a safety comment reduces the likelihood of emitting an unsound
/// impl in this case, and also provides useful documentation for readers of the
/// code.
///
/// ## Example
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// // Note that these derives are gated by `feature = "derive"`
/// #[cfg_attr(any(feature = "derive", test), derive(FromZeroes, FromBytes, AsBytes, Unaligned))]
/// #[repr(transparent)]
/// struct Wrapper<T>(T);
///
/// safety_comment! {
///     /// SAFETY:
///     /// `Wrapper<T>` is `repr(transparent)`, so it is sound to implement any
///     /// zerocopy trait if `T` implements that trait.
///     impl_or_verify!(T: FromZeroes => FromZeroes for Wrapper<T>);

///     impl_or_verify!(T: AsBytes => AsBytes for Wrapper<T>);
