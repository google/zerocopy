//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! ##### Conversion Traits
//!
//! Zerocopy provides four derivable traits for zero-cost conversions:
//! - [`TryFromBytes`] indicates that a type may safely be converted from
//!   certain byte sequences (conditional on runtime checks)
//! - [`FromZeros`] indicates that a sequence of zero bytes represents a valid
//!   instance of a type
//! - [`FromBytes`] indicates that a type may safely be converted from an
//!   arbitrary byte sequence
//! - [`IntoBytes`] indicates that a type may safely be converted *to* a byte
//!   sequence
//!
//! ##### Marker Traits
//!
//! Zerocopy provides three derivable marker traits that do not provide any
//! functionality themselves, but are required to call certain methods provided
//! by the conversion traits:
//! - [`KnownLayout`] indicates that zerocopy can reason about certain layout
//!   qualities of a type
//! - [`Immutable`] indicates that a type is free from interior mutability,
//!   except by ownership or an exclusive (`&mut`) borrow
//! - [`Unaligned`] indicates that a type's alignment requirement is 1
//!
//! You should generally derive these marker traits whenever possible.
//!
//! ##### Conversion Macros
//!
//! Zerocopy provides four macros for safe, zero-cost casting between types:
//!
//! - ([`try_`][try_transmute])[`transmute`] (conditionally) converts a value of
//!   one type to a value of another type of the same size
//! - [`transmute_mut`] converts a mutable reference of one type to a mutable
//!   reference of another type of the same size
//! - [`transmute_ref`] converts a mutable or immutable reference
//!   of one type to an immutable reference of another type of the same size
//!
//! These macros perform *compile-time* alignment and size checks, but cannot be
//! used in generic contexts. For generic conversions, use the methods defined
//! by the [conversion traits](#conversion-traits).
//!
//! ##### Byteorder-Aware Numerics
//!
//! Zerocopy provides byte-order aware integer types that support these
//! conversions; see the [`byteorder`] module. These types are especially useful
//! for network parsing.
//!
//! # Cargo Features
//!
//! - **`alloc`**   
//!   By default, `zerocopy` is `no_std`. When the `alloc` feature is enabled,
//!   the `alloc` crate is added as a dependency, and some allocation-related
//!   functionality is added.
//!
//! - **`derive`**   
//!   Provides derives for the core marker traits via the `zerocopy-derive`
//!   crate. These derives are re-exported from `zerocopy`, so it is not
//!   necessary to depend on `zerocopy-derive` directly.   
//!
//!   However, you may experience better compile times if you instead directly
//!   depend on both `zerocopy` and `zerocopy-derive` in your `Cargo.toml`,
//!   since doing so will allow Rust to compile these crates in parallel. To do
//!   so, do *not* enable the `derive` feature, and list both dependencies in
//!   your `Cargo.toml` with the same leading non-zero version number; e.g:
//!
//!   ```toml
//!   [dependencies]
//!   zerocopy = "0.X"
//!   zerocopy-derive = "0.X"
//!   ```
//!
//! - **`simd`**   
//!   When the `simd` feature is enabled, `FromZeros`, `FromBytes`, and
//!   `IntoBytes` impls are emitted for all stable SIMD types which exist on the
//!   target platform. Note that the layout of SIMD types is not yet stabilized,
//!   so these impls may be removed in the future if layout changes make them
//!   invalid. For more information, see the Unsafe Code Guidelines Reference
//!   page on the [layout of packed SIMD vectors][simd-layout].
//!
//! - **`simd-nightly`**   
//!   Enables the `simd` feature and adds support for SIMD types which are only
//!   available on nightly. Since these types are unstable, support for any type
//!   may be removed at any point in the future.
//!
//! [simd-layout]: https://rust-lang.github.io/unsafe-code-guidelines/layout/packed-simd-vectors.html
//!
//! # Security Ethos
//!
//! Zerocopy is expressly designed for use in security-critical contexts. We
//! strive to ensure that that zerocopy code is sound under Rust's current
//! memory model, and *any future memory model*. We ensure this by:
//! - **...not 'guessing' about Rust's semantics.**   
//!   We annotate `unsafe` code with a precise rationale for its soundness that
//!   cites a relevant section of Rust's official documentation. When Rust's
//!   documented semantics are unclear, we work with the Rust Operational
//!   Semantics Team to clarify Rust's documentation.
//! - **...rigorously testing our implementation.**   
//!   We run tests using [Miri], ensuring that zerocopy is sound across a wide
//!   array of supported target platforms of varying endianness and pointer
//!   width, and across both current and experimental memory models of Rust.
//! - **...formally proving the correctness of our implementation.**   
//!   We apply formal verification tools like [Kani][kani] to prove zerocopy's
//!   correctness.
//!
//! For more information, see our full [soundness policy].

//! # Relationship to Project Safe Transmute
//!
//! [Project Safe Transmute] is an official initiative of the Rust Project to
//! develop language-level support for safer transmutation. The Project consults
//! with crates like zerocopy to identify aspects of safer transmutation that
//! would benefit from compiler support, and has developed an [experimental,
//! compiler-supported analysis][mcp-transmutability] which determines whether,
//! for a given type, any value of that type may be soundly transmuted into
//! another type. Once this functionality is sufficiently mature, zerocopy
//! intends to replace its internal transmutability analysis (implemented by our
//! custom derives) with the compiler-supported one. This change will likely be
//! an implementation detail that is invisible to zerocopy's users.
//!
//! Project Safe Transmute will not replace the need for most of zerocopy's
//! higher-level abstractions. The experimental compiler analysis is a tool for
//! checking the soundness of `unsafe` code, not a tool to avoid writing
//! `unsafe` code altogether. For the foreseeable future, crates like zerocopy
//! will still be required in order to provide higher-level abstractions on top
//! of the building block provided by Project Safe Transmute.

/// outside of the "valid" set of bit patterns). If `unsafe` code produces an
/// invalid value, this is considered [undefined behavior].

/// types have three classes of bit patterns: those which are definitely valid,
/// and whose validity is documented in the language; those which may or may not
/// be considered valid at some point in the future; and those which are
/// definitely invalid.
///
/// Zerocopy takes a conservative approach, and only considers a bit pattern to
/// be valid if its validity is a documenteed guarantee provided by the
/// language.
///
/// For most use cases, Rust's current guarantees align with programmers'
/// intuitions about what ought to be valid. As a result, zerocopy's
/// conservatism should not affect most users.
///
/// If you are negatively affected by lack of support for a particular type,
/// we encourage you to let us know by [filing an issue][github-repo].
///
/// # `TryFromBytes` is not symmetrical with [`IntoBytes`]
///
/// There are some types which implement both `TryFromBytes` and [`IntoBytes`],
/// but for which `TryFromBytes` is not guaranteed to accept all byte sequences
/// produced by `IntoBytes`. In other words, for some `T: TryFromBytes +
/// IntoBytes`, there exist values of `t: T` such that

/// generally assume that values produced by `IntoBytes` will necessarily be

/// determine whether it is sound to implement `FromBytes` for a given type.
/// Unless you are modifying the implementation of this derive, or attempting to
/// manually implement `FromBytes` for a type yourself, you don't need to read
/// this section.*
///
/// If a type has the following properties, then this derive can implement
/// `FromBytes` for that type:
///
/// - If the type is a struct, all of its fields must be `FromBytes`.
/// - If the type is an enum:
///   - It must be a C-like enum (meaning that all variants have no fields).
///   - It must have a defined representation (`repr`s `C`, `u8`, `u16`, `u32`,
///     `u64`, `usize`, `i8`, `i16`, `i32`, `i64`, or `isize`).
///   - The maximum number of discriminants must be used (so that every possible
///     bit pattern is a valid one). Be very careful when using the `C`,
///     `usize`, or `isize` representations, as their size is
///     platform-dependent.
///
/// This analysis is subject to change. Unsafe code may *only* rely on the
/// documented [safety conditions] of `FromBytes`, and must *not* rely on the
/// implementation details of this derive.
///
/// ## Why isn't an explicit representation required for structs?
///
/// Neither this derive, nor the [safety conditions] of `FromBytes`, requires
/// that structs are marked with `#[repr(C)]`.
///
/// Per the [Rust reference](reference),
///
/// > The representation of a type can change the padding between fields, but
/// does not change the layout of the fields themselves.
///
/// [reference]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/type-layout.html#representations
///
/// Since the layout of structs only consists of padding bytes and field bytes,
/// a struct is soundly `FromBytes` if:
/// 1. its padding is soundly `FromBytes`, and
/// 2. its fields are soundly `FromBytes`.
///
/// The answer to the first question is always yes: padding bytes do not have

/// This error indicates that the type being annotated has padding bytes, which

/// # Analysis
///
/// *This section describes, roughly, the analysis performed by this derive to
/// determine whether it is sound to implement `IntoBytes` for a given type.
/// Unless you are modifying the implementation of this derive, or attempting to
/// manually implement `IntoBytes` for a type yourself, you don't need to read
/// this section.*
///
/// If a type has the following properties, then this derive can implement
/// `IntoBytes` for that type:
///
/// - If the type is a struct:
///   - It must have a defined representation (`repr(C)`, `repr(transparent)`,
///     or `repr(packed)`).
///   - All of its fields must be `IntoBytes`.
///   - Its layout must have no padding. This is always true for
///     `repr(transparent)` and `repr(packed)`. For `repr(C)`, see the layout
///     algorithm described in the [Rust Reference].
/// - If the type is an enum:
///   - It must be a C-like enum (meaning that all variants have no fields).
///   - It must have a defined representation (`repr`s `C`, `u8`, `u16`, `u32`,
///     `u64`, `usize`, `i8`, `i16`, `i32`, `i64`, or `isize`).
///
/// This analysis is subject to change. Unsafe code may *only* rely on the
/// documented [safety conditions] of `FromBytes`, and must *not* rely on the
/// implementation details of this derive.
