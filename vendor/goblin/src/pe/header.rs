///
/// Nowadays, only two fields from
/// the DOS header are used on Windows: [`signature` (aka `e_magic`)](DosHeader::signature)
/// and [`pe_pointer` (aka `e_lfanew`)](DosHeader::pe_pointer).

/// The DOS header is located at the beginning of the PE file and is usually followed by the [DosStub].

///
/// The subset of the structure spanning from its start to the [`overlay_number` (aka `e_ovno`)](DosHeader::overlay_number) field
/// included (i.e. till the offset 0x1C) used to be commonly known as "formatted header", since their position and contents were
/// fixed. Optional information used by overlay managers could have followed the formatted header. In the absence of optional
/// information, the formatted header was followed by the ["relocation pointer table"](https://www.tavi.co.uk/phobos/exeformat.html#reloctable).
///
/// Overlays were sections of a program that remained on disk until the program actually required them. Different overlays
/// could thus share the same memory area. The overlays were loaded and unloaded by special code provided by the program
